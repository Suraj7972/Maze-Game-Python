Title: Maze Game with Maximum Expected Utility (MEU)

Description:
This Python script implements a simple maze game where the player navigates a 2D grid-based maze from a starting position to a goal position. The game incorporates the concept of Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) to guide the player's decisions.

Key Features:

Maze Generation: A predefined maze is used, but the code can be extended to generate random mazes.
Player Movement: The player can move up, down, left, or right within the maze.
Goal State: A specific cell in the maze is designated as the goal.
Utility Function: The utility function assigns values to each cell in the maze, representing the expected reward or penalty for reaching that cell. The goal cell has a high positive utility, while obstacles have negative utilities.
MEU-Based Decision Making: The player's movement is not random. Instead, the script calculates the expected utility of each possible move and chooses the move with the highest utility. This simulates a rational agent making decisions based on the expected outcomes.
How to Run:

Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have the pygame library installed. You can install it using pip:

Bash
pip install pygame
Use code with caution.

Run the Script:
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., maze_game.py) and execute it from your terminal:

Bash
python maze_game.py
Use code with caution.

Play the Game:
Use the arrow keys to move the player within the maze. The goal is to reach the red square.

Potential Enhancements:

Dynamic Maze Generation: Implement algorithms to generate random mazes of varying complexity.
Advanced Utility Functions: Explore more sophisticated utility functions that consider factors like distance to the goal, obstacles, and potential rewards/penalties.
Learning-Based Agents: Integrate machine learning techniques to train an agent to learn optimal strategies for navigating the maze.
Visualization: Visualize the utility values on the maze to help understand the agent's decision-making process.
This project provides a basic implementation of a maze game with MEU-based decision making. It can be further extended and customized to create more complex and challenging scenarios.
